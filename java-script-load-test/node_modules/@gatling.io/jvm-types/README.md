# Gatling JS - JVM types module

Gatling JS is a JavaScript/TypeScript interface for the [Gatling load testing tool](https://gatling.io/).

This package is an internal dependency used by other Gatling JS packages. You do not need to depend directly on it.

To get started with Gatling JS, see our [introduction to JavaScript scripting](https://docs.gatling.io/tutorials/scripting-intro-js); or simply have a look at [our demo projects](https://github.com/gatling/gatling-js-demo).
